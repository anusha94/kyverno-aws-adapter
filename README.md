# kyverno-aws-adapter

## Description
Kyverno AWS Adapter is a Kubernetes controller for the `AWSConfig` CRD. As of now, it observes the realtime state of an EKS cluster an reconciles it with the current state, but can be further expanded to other AWS services later on by extending the current API with the help of [AWS SDK for Go v2](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2).

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install the `AWSConfig` CRD:

```sh
make install
```

2. Install the Helm chart after making any necessary changes to `config/helm/kyverno-aws-adapter/values.yaml`
	
```sh
helm install kyverno-aws-adapter config/helm/kyverno-aws-adapter
```
3. Check the `status` field of the `eks-status` custom resource in the required namespace. If the namespace is `kyverno-aws-adapter`, then:
```sh
kubectl get awsconfig eks-status -n kyverno-aws-adapter -o yaml 
```

## Modifying Source Code

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

More information can be found via the [Kubebuilder Documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/introduction.html)

## Helm Values
Currently supported values for the Helm chart are as follows:
| Value | Description |
-- | ---
| `namespace` | Namespace for installing the controller and CRD |
| `nameOverride` | Override the chart name |
| `fullnameOverride` | Override the entire generated name |
| `eksCluster` | Configuration for EKS cluster's `name` and `region` |
| `dockerconfigjson` | Dockerconfigjson for the image secret |
| `replicaCount` | Number of replicas for the controller |
| `syncPeriod` | Interval for controller reconciliation |
| `image` | Configuration for image `name`, `tag` and `pullPolicy` |
| `serviceAccount` | Configuration for `serviceAccount` creation and naming|
| `securityContext` | `securityContext` for the containers in Pods |
| `podSecurityContext` | `securityContext` for the Pods |
| `roleArn` | IAM Role ARN with required permissions for the EKS cluster |


## IAM Role for Service Account
This adapter utilizes the IAM Role ARN associated with any policy that has the following permissions for the EKS cluster:

| Permission |
---
| ListAddons |
| ListClusters |
| ListFargateProfiles |
| ListIdentityProviderConfigs |
| ListNodeGroups |
| ListUpdates |
| AccessKubernetesApi |
| DescribeAddon |
| DescribeAddonVersions |
| DescribeCluster |
| DescribeFargateProfile |
| DescribeIdentityProviderConfig |
| DescribeNodegroup |
| DescribeUpdate |
| ListTagsForResource |

You can specify the Role ARN in the `roleArn` field within the Helm chart's `values.yaml` file.

Please ensure that the trust relationship policy for your IAM role resembles the following format:
```json
{
  "Version": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::$account_id:oidc-provider/$oidc_provider"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "$oidc_provider:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com",
          "$oidc_provider:sub": "system:serviceaccount:$namespace:$service_account"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

For detailed instructions on how to configure the IAM role for service account, check out the official AWS documentation on [IAM roles for service accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/associate-service-account-role.html).
